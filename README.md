Image Classifier APP
The Idea:
The app will take a photo of unknown bird, insect, or a plant as input from the user and should return the name of that thing 
and if the user need to know more about that thing he entered when he click the name our app returned as output it will search 
for him for the output in google for more photos and information.
**Our app can classify three categories like in the figure insects, plants, and birds**
We will an AI model, train it with a dataset contains 15000 images for birds, insects, and plants and each has its label
After training and testing the output of the model we will take it and display it to the user
